I am a computational biologist working on biomolecules and soft matter. Currently, I am a postdoctoral fellow
at [IIT Delhi](https://home.iitd.ac.in/){:target="_blank"}, working on dye molecule aggregation using molecular dynamics simulations. I did my Ph.D. at [IIIT
Hyderabad](https://www.iiit.ac.in/){:target="_blank"} with Prof. [Abhijit Mitra](https://faculty.iiit.ac.in/~abi_chem/web/){:target="_blank"} and Prof. [Gopalakrishnan Bulusu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gopalakrishnan-bulusu-82a1705/?originalSubdomain=in){:target="_blank"}. I worked on the structure and dynamics of
the Smoothened receptor (class F GPCR) and its interactions with lipids, as well as receptor activation upon small
molecule binding using atomistic and coarse‑grained molecular dynamics simulations.
