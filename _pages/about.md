I am a computational biologist working on biomolecules in [Prof. Wonpil Im's lab](https://compbio.lehigh.edu/){:target="_blank"} as a postdoctoral fellow. Currently, I am working on elucidating the state transition mechanism of the organic cation transporter 1 (OCT1) using enhanced-sampling molecular dynamics simulations. I also worked as a postdoctoral fellow at [IIT Delhi](https://home.iitd.ac.in/){:target="_blank"} with [Prof. Divya Nayar](https://sites.google.com/prod/view/divyanayar/){:target="_blank"} on dye molecule aggregation and small peptide aggregation using molecular dynamics simulations. I did my Ph.D. at [IIIT Hyderabad](https://www.iiit.ac.in/){:target="_blank"} with [Prof. Abhijit Mitra](https://faculty.iiit.ac.in/~abi_chem/web/){:target="_blank"} and [Prof. Gopalakrishnan Bulusu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gopalakrishnan-bulusu-82a1705/?originalSubdomain=in){:target="_blank"}. I worked on the structure and dynamics of the Smoothened receptor (class F GPCR) and its interactions with lipids, as well as receptor activation upon small molecule binding using atomistic and coarse‑grained molecular dynamics simulations.
