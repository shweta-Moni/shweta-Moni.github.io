I am a computational biologist working on biomolecules and soft matter. Currently, I am a postdoctoral fellow
at IIT Delhi, working on dye molecule aggregation using molecular dynamics simulations. I did my Ph.D. at IIIT
Hyderabad with Prof. Abhijit Mitra and Prof. Gopalakrishnan Bulusu. I worked on the structure and dynamics of
the Smoothened receptor (class F GPCR) and its interactions with lipids, as well as receptor activation upon small
molecule binding using atomistic and coarse‑grained molecular dynamics simulations.

Ph.D. Thesis on
======
Structure and dynamics of Smoothened (SMO)– a potential target for regulation of the Hedgehog (HH) signaling pathway.

Research Interest
======
1. Molecular Dynamics simulation (atomistic and coarse-grained)
1. G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs): structure and dynamics
1. Membrane-lipid/small molecule interaction
1. Material science
